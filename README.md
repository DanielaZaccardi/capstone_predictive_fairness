# Predictive Modeling and Fairness in Higher Education: A Case Study with FIU Admissions Data
A case study on predictive modeling and algorithmic fairness using Florida International University (FIU) undergraduate admissions data, exploring bias detection, mitigation techniques, and model performance trade-offs.

### Abstract
Predictive models are increasingly used in university admissions, offering opportunities to improve decision-making but raising concerns about the amplification of historical inequities. This project investigates predictive modeling and algorithmic fairness using Florida International University’s Fall 2024 undergraduate applicant dataset. After data preparation, including handling missing values, creating unified test score features, and discretizing key variables, we evaluated several machine learning models to assess predictive performance and identify the strongest predictors of admission. Results show that academic preparation and admission type are the most influential predictors, while demographic attributes do not significantly affect model decisions, an encouraging sign for fairness. However, fairness analysis across demographic groups revealed consistent disparities in selection rates and error-rate patterns, indicating structural imbalances in the underlying data rather than model-specific bias. To address these disparities, we applied pre-processing mitigation techniques, including Random Oversampling and SMOTE. Oversampling notably improved fairness for underrepresented groups with minimal impact on model performance. The study demonstrates that fairness can be enhanced without sacrificing accuracy and highlights the need for ongoing evaluation, broader datasets, and intersectional analyses in future work.
